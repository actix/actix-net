/// A synchronization primitive for task wakeup.
///
/// Sometimes the task interested in a given event will change over time. A `LocalWaker` can
/// coordinate concurrent notifications with the consumer, potentially "updating" the underlying
/// task to wake up. This is useful in scenarios where a computation completes in another task and
/// wants to notify the consumer, but the consumer is in the process of being migrated to a new
/// logical task.
///
/// Consumers should call [`register`] before checking the result of a computation and producers
/// should call [`wake`] after producing the computation (this differs from the usual `thread::park`
/// pattern). It is also permitted for [`wake`] to be called _before_ [`register`]. This results in
/// a no-op.
///
/// A single `LocalWaker` may be reused for any number of calls to [`register`] or [`wake`].
///
/// [`register`]: LocalWaker::register
/// [`wake`]: LocalWaker::wake
