/// An asynchronous operation from `Request` to a `Response`.
///
/// The `Service` trait models a request/response interaction, receiving requests and returning
/// replies. You can think about a service as a function with one argument that returns some result
/// asynchronously. Conceptually, the operation looks like this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// async fn(Request) -> Result<Response, Err>
/// ```
///
/// The `Service` trait just generalizes this form. Requests are defined as a generic type parameter
/// and responses and other details are defined as associated types on the trait impl. Notice that
/// this design means that services can receive many request types and converge them to a single
/// response type.
///
/// Services can also have mutable state that influence computation by using a `Cell`, `RefCell`
/// or `Mutex`. Services intentionally do not take `&mut self` to reduce overhead in the
/// common cases.
///
/// `Service` provides a symmetric and uniform API; the same abstractions can be used to represent
/// both clients and servers. Services describe only _transformation_ operations which encourage
/// simple API surfaces. This leads to simpler design of each service, improves test-ability and
/// makes composition easier.
///
/// ```ignore
/// struct MyService;
///
/// impl Service<u8> for MyService {
///      type Response = u64;
///      type Error = MyError;
///      type Future = Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>>>>;
///
///      fn poll_ready(&self, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Result<(), Self::Error>> { ... }
///
///      fn call(&self, req: u8) -> Self::Future { ... }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Sometimes it is not necessary to implement the Service trait. For example, the above service
/// could be rewritten as a simple function and passed to [`fn_service`](fn_service()).
///
/// ```ignore
/// async fn my_service(req: u8) -> Result<u64, MyError>;
///
/// let svc = fn_service(my_service)
/// svc.call(123)
/// ```
pub trait Service<Req> {
    /// Responses given by the service.
    type Response;

    /// Errors produced by the service when polling readiness or executing call.
    type Error;

    /// The future response value.
    type Future: Future<Output = Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>>;

    /// Returns `Ready` when the service is able to process requests.
    ///
    /// If the service is at capacity, then `Pending` is returned and the task is notified when the
    /// service becomes ready again. This function is expected to be called while on a task.
    ///
    /// This is a best effort implementation. False positives are permitted. It is permitted for
    /// the service to return `Ready` from a `poll_ready` call and the next invocation of `call`
    /// results in an error.
    ///

    /// take care to not call `poll_ready`. If the service is at capacity and the request is unable
    /// to be handled, the returned `Future` should resolve to an error.

/// connection.
